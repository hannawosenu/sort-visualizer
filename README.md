# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Java application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms through visual animations. Users can interact with the application to observe how different sorting algorithms rearrange elements within an array to achieve ordered sequences.

**Running the Application**
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the Main class to start the application.

**Usage**
1. Upon launching the application, a main window will appear, displaying the available sorting algorithms.
2. Click on a sorting algorithm button (e.g., "Bubble Sort," "Insertion Sort," etc.) to start the visualization of that algorithm.
3. Adjust the animation speed using the slider located in the interface.
4. Watch as the algorithm rearranges the elements in the array, with the animation reflecting the sorting process.
